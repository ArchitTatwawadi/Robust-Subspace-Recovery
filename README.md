# Robust-Subspace-Recovery
In this project I along with my colleagues, discussed and implemented 3 different papers on robust subspace recovery to detect the outliers in a video. This was done using a method called as coherence pursuit algorithm. We implemented this in matlab. The code is at the end of the report.
